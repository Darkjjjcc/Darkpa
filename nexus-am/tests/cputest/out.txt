invalid opcode(PC = 0x801000e8): 00c6d663 00078593 ...

There are two cases which will trigger this unexpected exception:
1. The instruction at PC = 0x801000e8 is not implemented.
2. Something is implemented incorrectly.
Find this PC(0x801000e8) in the disassembling result to distinguish which case it is.

[1;31mIf it is the first case, see

* Every line of untested code is always wrong![0m
